# Counter Intuitive

This is an intuitive counter app, okay? It's not done yet, but when it is, you can expect to be using some intuitive counters to help you keep running counts of whatever your little heart desires. You'll be able to label them, change their colors, move them around; it's gonna be nuts.
Full disclosure: I just wanted a simple React project to work on here and there. But who knows, it might end up being pretty cool! **

** It definitely will.
